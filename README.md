# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This project utilizes machine learning for recognizing traffic signs in real-time using the device's camera or selected images. The app processes images with TensorFlow and classifies them using a trained model. This can be used for traffic sign detection applications, aiding drivers with automatic sign recognition or for educational purposes in traffic safety.

## Features

- **Traffic Sign Recognition:** Classify traffic signs using a pre-trained model (TensorFlow).
- **Real-time Camera Integration:** Capture and analyze traffic signs in real-time using the device camera.
- **Image Processing:** Use TensorFlow for lightweight image classification.

## Requirements
- Android Studio
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17
